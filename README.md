# Order Blocks ICT Multi TF MT4

This code is a sample implementation of the **Order Blocks ICT Multi TF MT4** strategy, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The purpose of this strategy is to identify order blocks, detect support and resistance zones, determine potential trend reversals or continuations, and perform multi-timeframe analysis in the foreign exchange (forex) market.

## Functionality

The code includes the following functions:

1. `identifyOrderBlocks`: This function takes a price chart as input and identifies order blocks based on certain criteria. It returns a vector of `OrderBlock` structures, where each structure represents an identified order block.

2. `detectSupportResistanceZones`: This function takes a price chart as input and detects support and resistance zones based on certain criteria. It returns a vector of double values, where each value represents a detected support or resistance zone.

3. `determineTrendReversals`: This function takes a price chart as input and determines whether a potential trend reversal is detected. It returns a boolean value indicating whether a trend reversal is detected.

4. `performMultiTimeframeAnalysis`: This function takes multiple price charts as input and performs multi-timeframe analysis to identify trends and potential trading opportunities.

## Usage

The main function of the code demonstrates the usage of the above functions:

1. It initializes a sample price chart.
2. It calls the `identifyOrderBlocks` function to identify order blocks in the price chart.
3. It calls the `detectSupportResistanceZones` function to detect support and resistance zones in the price chart.
4. It calls the `determineTrendReversals` function to determine if a trend reversal is detected in the price chart.
5. It calls the `performMultiTimeframeAnalysis` function to perform multi-timeframe analysis using the sample price chart.
6. It outputs the results, including the number of order blocks identified, the number of support and resistance zones detected, and whether a trend reversal is detected.
